# Renoir
In this project I am going to be working on a first-mobile module, in which I will be reinforcing knowledge of CSS Grid. It is a gallery based on the masterpieces of Renoir in essence.
This project was intended to be a Michelangelo paintings based website, but as the development advanced the approach corresponding with design in relation with his pieces also changed.
